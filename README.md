This is my presentation given at RailsConf 2013.

It's meant to be an intermediate-level talk that introduces the concept of asynchronous workers and gives examples using Resque 1.x, but emphasizes the concepts rather than Resque-specific code. Comparisons to other asynchronous processing techniques are given, but there's only so much you can do in 40 minutes, so detail is somewhat light.

Hopefully it's enough to stimulate your curiosity and get you to look up more information!

I hope you find this useful and that it makes your work easier and/or (hopefully and?) more enjoyable.
